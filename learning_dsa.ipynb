    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given an array of length N, finding the elements at specific indexes will need us to just access those specific elements requiring $O(1)$ or constant time complexity. \n",

    "1. Finding elements at an index ($O(1)$)\n",

    "\n",
    "Note: Python only has dynamic arrays implemented as multiple static arrays over time under the hood. To accommodate new elements, the size of array is doubled at every step so appending at end is $*O(1)$ since there's usually space while insertion at random position is $O(N)$ since other elements need to be copied and shifted to make new array."
