    "# Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big O Notation, also known as the Bachman-Landau notation or the asymptotic notation, describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends to a particular number or infinity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of computer science, the notation is used to describe the limiting computational complexity of an algorithm. The computational complexity has two parts- time complexity and space complexity. The Big O for algorithms thus tells us how the time and space (memory) requirements of an algorithm ($O(f(n))$) change with change in the input size ($n$). \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation ignores constants and only takes the maximum term in $f(n)$. Typically there are 3 scenarios: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Best Case \n",
    "- Average Case\n",
    "- Worst Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly acceptable complexity is $O(nlogn)$ and is also most common for sorting algorithms. A logarithmic complexity usually indicates that the input is being reduced by a percentage at every step of the algorithm. "

    "The time complexity of a given algorithm indicates the changing time requirements via change in number of operations with input size. It is not meant to be an exact count of number of operations but rather the change in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given an array of length N, finding the elements at specific indexes will need us to just access those specific elements requiring $O(1)$ or constant time complexity. \n",
    "2. Given a array of length N, finding squares of each element will need us to go through N elements requiring $O(N)$ time or linear time complexity.\n",
    "3. Given the same array, finding the unique combinations of all elements will need us to loop through the array and also loop through the array for each element in the array requiring $O(N^2)$ time or exponential time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphical View: If we plot N on X-axis and number of operations on Y-axis, then example 1 will be a constant horizontal graph, example 2 will be a linear graph while example 3 will be an exponential graph (which is usually the worst case time complexity). "
