    "4. Action: A step taken by the agent to bring about a change of state in its environment.\n",
    "5. Reward: A score given to the agent as a result of that action.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. At each time step *t*= **0,1,2,...**, agent is at a state $S_t \\in S$ and takes an action $A_t \\in A$. So, for each time step, we have a state-action pair $(S_t, A_t)$.\n",
